# Forkify üç≥

This project is a full-featured recipe application built with React, created as part of **Jonas Schmedtmann's Ultimate React Course**. It's designed to teach modern React development fundamentals by building a fully functional front-end application.

## üöÄ **Features**

- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for recipes using a real-time API.
- **Dynamic Recipe Details**: The app displays detailed information for each recipe, including ingredients, cooking time, and servings.
- **Servings Adjustment**: Users can dynamically change the number of servings, which automatically updates the ingredient quantities.
- **Bookmarks**: Users can save their favorite recipes to a personal bookmarks list, which is stored locally.
- **Recipe Upload**: The application allows users to upload their own recipes, which are then added to the application.
- **Modern React Hooks**: The project is built using functional components and modern **React Hooks** (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useReducer`), reflecting current best practices.
- **State Management**: It demonstrates robust state management using `useReducer` and `Context API` for more complex, application-wide state.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technologies Used**

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Context API & `useReducer`**: For managing application-wide state.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: The core programming language.
- **Vite**: A fast and modern front-end build tool.

## üìñ **Learning Outcomes**

This project was a comprehensive learning experience, covering key React concepts such as:

- **Component-based architecture**: Building a modular and reusable UI.
- **State management**: Effectively handling application data using `useState` and the **Context API** combined with the **`useReducer` pattern** to manage global application state.
- **Conditional rendering**: Displaying different UI elements based on specific conditions.
- **Data fetching**: Handling asynchronous API calls to load recipe data.
- **Custom Hooks**: Abstracting reusable logic into custom hooks (e.g., for managing API calls or local storage).
- **Managing Side Effects**: Using the `useEffect` hook to handle side effects like data fetching and DOM manipulation.
